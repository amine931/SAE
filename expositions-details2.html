                    <h3>A dive into the evolution of school textbooks</h3>
                    <p>This exhibition traces the fascinating evolution of school textbooks and their illustrations from the 15th to the 18th century, a period marked by profound transformations in education and the dissemination of knowledge.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The beginnings of printing</h3>
                    <p>With Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in the mid-15th century, books gradually became more accessible. The first printed textbooks appeared, often richly illustrated with woodcuts. These works, still rare and valuable, were primarily intended for elites and religious institutions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Renaissance and Humanism</h3>
                    <p>The 16th century saw the emergence of new pedagogical approaches influenced by humanism. Textbooks were enriched with more detailed illustrations, particularly in the fields of anatomy, botany, and astronomy. The exhibition features reproductions of these remarkable works, which contributed to the dissemination of scientific knowledge at the time.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Grand Siècle</h3>
                    <p>In the 17th century, under Louis XIV, education became a political issue. Textbooks reflected this evolution with more standardized content and illustrations glorifying the monarchy. This section of the exhibition highlights how school textbooks became instruments for constructing a national identity.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Enlightenment</h3>
                    <p>The 18th century, with the Enlightenment movement, saw a profound transformation in educational content. Textbooks incorporated more scientific and philosophical knowledge, with innovative educational illustrations. The exhibition presents how these works contributed to the dissemination of new ideas that paved the way for the major transformations of the end of the century.</p>

                    <h3>Education in times of conflict</h3>
                    <p>This exhibition examines how periods of war and occupation profoundly influenced the content and form of school textbooks, transforming these educational tools into instruments of propaganda, resistance, or adaptation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The First World War</h3>
                    <p>During the Great War (1914-1918), school textbooks became vehicles for patriotism. The exhibition presents striking examples where arithmetic uses battle-related problems, geography focuses on disputed territories, and literature exalts national heroism.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The interwar period</h3>
                    <p>This period saw the emergence of textbooks promoting peace and international cooperation, in response to the horrors of the First World War. At the same time, in some countries, textbooks began to reflect the rise of totalitarian ideologies, with increasingly politically oriented illustrations and texts.</p>
                    
                    <h3>World War II and the Occupation</h3>
                    <p>During the Occupation (1940-1944), French school textbooks underwent a radical transformation. The exhibition highlights the changes imposed by the Vichy regime and the German occupiers: revision of history, introduction of anti-Semitic propaganda, and glorification of manual labor and traditional values.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Resistance through education</h3>
                    <p>At the same time, the exhibition features fascinating examples of clandestine textbooks produced by the Resistance, as well as testimonies from teachers who continued to educate according to their values ​​despite the constraints. These rare documents illustrate how education became a terrain of intellectual resistance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Post-war and reconstruction</h3>
                    <p>The post-war period saw a complete overhaul of school textbooks, with the elimination of collaborationist content and the introduction of new narratives about the war, the Resistance, and deportation. The exhibition shows how these textbooks contributed to the construction of the collective memory of this traumatic period.</p>
